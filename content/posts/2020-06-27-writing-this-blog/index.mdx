This post serves both to help others duplicate my work, and remind me how I did it myself, if ever I forget. At the bottom I'll probably keep it updated with all my Markdown quick references, since I'll be using this as my primary reference doc for writing other blog posts.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo: [gatsby-starter-morning-dew](https://github.com/maxpou/gatsby-starter-morning-dew)
2. Change repo name as required ([Github Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/))
3. `git clone git@github.com:/your_name/your_name.github.io.git your_blog.github.io` - downloads your repository.
4. `git checkout -b development` - creates a branch called "development" so we can edit the blog source code.
5. Inside the file "packages.json", add the following to your `"scripts": {}` block:
    ```"deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public -b master",```
  This pushes the compiled code to our master branch for Github Pages to host.
6. Once changes are finalized to the development branch, `git commit -am "I changed a file"`,  `git push`, and `npm run deploy`
7. Sit back and enjoy your blog 👓!

Thanks to MDX, It is now possible to add JSX in Markdown! Below is an example of JSX embedded in Markdown. <br />

> MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast 🚀.


**Example:**

<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato' }}>
  <h3>This is JSX in Markdown</h3>
  {console.log('hello MDX')}
</div>

Code:

```jsx
<div style={{ padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato' }}>
  <h3>This is JSX in Markdown</h3>
  {console.log('hello MDX')}
</div>
```


## How-to?

```jsx{5}
import MySuperComponent from '../path/to/MySuperComponent'

# Some text in Markdown

<MySuperComponent />

other text in markdown
```

It's now posible to generate preview images for social networks ([Twitter](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator), Slack, LinkedIn...).

![twitter card](./twitter-card.png)

This great idea come from a [conversation](https://twitter.com/_maxpou/status/1054106299213012992) I had with Luciano Mammino (aka [@Loige](https://twitter.com/loige)). I basically took 85% of his code. Thanks Luciano 😊


**How to do it?**

1. Open 2 terminals:
  ```bash
  # Terminal 1
  npm run dev

  # Terminal 2
  npm run generatePostPreviewImages
  # ..you can also specify the url (if different from http://localhost:8000/)
  npm run generatePostPreviewImages http://localhost:1234/
  ```
2. In the post's header, add the generated images:
  ```yaml
  title: My blog post
  # ...
  imageShare: ./social-media-card-generator-share.png
  ```

Gatsby will first create extra url suffixed by `/image_share` (i.e. *http://localhost:8000/gatsby-starter-morning-dew-v1-1/image_share*). Then, Pupetter will take a snapshot and add it to your `post` folder.

**💡Quick tip:** If you want to recreate this pictures

```bash
# delete all share images
find ./content -name "*-share.png" -type f -delete
```

If you want to skip the file generation for some posts, add `generate-card: false` to the post's header.

```yaml
---
title: My blog post
# ...
generate-card: false
---
```

## How it works?
  
1. copy/paste the image in the post folder
2. `![put image description here](./git-push-force.gif)`

NOTE: This "post" is based on [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and is meant to test styling of Markdown generated documents.

This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

This cheatsheet is specifically *Markdown Here's* version of Github-flavored Markdown. This differs slightly in styling and syntax from what Github uses, so what you see below might vary a little from what you get in a *Markdown Here* email, but it should be pretty close.

You can play around with Markdown on our [live demo page](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

(If you're not a Markdown Here user, check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet](./Markdown-Cheatsheet) that is not specific to MDH. But, really, you should also use Markdown Here, because it's awesome. http://markdown-here.com)

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Links

There are two ways to create links.

```no-highlight
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks <code>```</code>, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.
```
</code></pre>



```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github).
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Again, to see what languages are available for highlighting, and how to write those language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

<a name="tables"/>

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```no-highlight
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```

## Blockquotes

```no-highlight
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can put **Markdown** into a blockquote.
```

<a name="html"/>

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```no-highlight
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="hr"/>

## Horizontal Rule

```
Three or more...

---

Hyphens

***

Asterisks

___

Underscores
```

## Line Breaks

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit &lt;Enter&gt; once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

```
Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
```

This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...

(Technical note: *Markdown Here* uses GFM line breaks, so there's no need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)

<a name="videos"/>

## YouTube Videos

They can't be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:

```no-highlight
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8AkLfYOgIrE
" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/8AkLfYOgIrE/0.jpg"
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
```

Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:

```no-highlight
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
```
