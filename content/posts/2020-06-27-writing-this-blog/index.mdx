This post serves both to help others duplicate my work, and remind me how I did it myself, if ever I forget. At the bottom I'll probably keep it updated with all my Markdown quick references, since I'll be using this as my primary reference doc for writing other blog posts.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo: [gatsby-starter-morning-dew](https://github.com/maxpou/gatsby-starter-morning-dew)
2. Change repo name as required ([Github Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/))
3. Download your repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:/your_name/your_name.github.io.git your_blog.github.io
```
4. Create a branch called "develop" so we can edit the blog source code:
```
git checkout -b develop
```
5. Inside the file `packages.json`, add the following to your `"scripts": {}` block. This pushes the compiled code to our master branch for Github Pages to host:
```
"deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public -b master",
```
6. Once changes are finalized to the development branch, 
```
git commit -am "I changed a file"
git push
npm run deploy
```
7. Sit back and enjoy your blog ðŸ‘“!


## Usage & Examples

title: "How to generate social share images"
slug: social-media-card-generator
date: 2018-11-13
language: en
cover: ./cover-balloons.jpg
imageShare: ./social-media-card-generator-share.png
tags:

```

The above is an example header for a new blog entry. All blog posts should be filed under 

`/content/posts/yyyy-mm-dd-post_title`

One file is required, another recommended:

1. `index.mdx` will become the post itself (required)
2. `cover-balloons.jpg`, or whatever your desired cover image is named (recommended)

After the post is finished, execute the npm deploy command created above to make your changes live.

## Further Reading

For more examples & references, see the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and is meant to test styling of Markdown generated documents.

This is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For more complete info, see [John Gruber's original spec](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the [Github-flavored Markdown info page](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

This cheatsheet is specifically *Markdown Here's* version of Github-flavored Markdown. This differs slightly in styling and syntax from what Github uses, so what you see below might vary a little from what you get in a *Markdown Here* email, but it should be pretty close.

You can play around with Markdown on our [live demo page](http://www.markdown-here.com/livedemo.html).

(If you're not a Markdown Here user, check out the [Markdown Cheatsheet](./Markdown-Cheatsheet) that is not specific to MDH. But, really, you should also use Markdown Here, because it's awesome. http://markdown-here.com)
